#### A two-stat magic system
    Player: {
        health: 0,
        stamina: 0,
        power: 0,
    }

Stamina becomes the energy element, with power being the scalar. Health remains the lifespan. Stamina drains when action is taken and renews rapidly under normal conditions, and slowly when under a negative effect. Under positive effect it doesnt drain at all. Power is the scalar by which [damage/shield duration] is calculated. Increasing power does not increase capacity, only damage. Stamina increases capacity for action, but not the power of the action.
